RCE report


=== What is RCE ? ===

RCE is short for Remote Code Execution.
It is an injection attack where user input is passed to a code that executes a command containing
said input.


=== How can it be exploited ===

Consider the following PHP snippet :

$myvar = "varname";
$x = $_GET['arg'];
eval("\$myvar = \$x;");

Its function is to execute input from a GET argument.
However, if the input is not sanitized, adding the following parameter : /index.php?arg=1; phpinfo()
will cause the phpinfo method to execute.

This is a devastating vulnerability as it can allow the opening of a shell and access to everything.


=== How it can be fixed ===

The cause of this vulnerability is bad practice coding and trusted user input.

The best way to fix this is to never evaluate user input. If the code is already written,
any user input should be thoroughly validated to avoid dangerous characters.


=== How it was found ===

By using the payload ;echo "payload123456789" in all fields and parameters we can monitor
the response for the string and deduce that the code has been executed. We however have to make
sure that our input wasn't just reflected back without being executed.
